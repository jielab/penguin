> ## The idea is that a basic tree with "infrastructral nodes" is constructed   
> - ### This basic tree is like the "London Eye", relatively stable.
> - ### When more and more virus sequence is added, like the tree leaves, some of the "novel" leaves could potentially move the tree a tiny bit.
> - ### The following visualization is from "Wind and Words" By Impossible Bureau, ranked "The 25 Best Data Visualizations of 2018".

> ## Ideally, we could see the virus mutation data like below
> > - ### it is "graph-based". As we know, ACGT does not read well, and mutation is not simply single letter substitution.
> > - ### it is good to have "head-to-head comparison"

> ## Finally, we aim to dilver a visualization accessible to everyone, just like the screen protection image on Mac OS
