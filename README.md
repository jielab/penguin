# penguin: Polygenic Evaluation of Novel Genome Using Infrastructral Nodes 


> ## Ideally, we could see the virus mutation data like below
> > ### graph-based
> > ### head-to-head comparison

> ## The idea is that a basic tree with "infrastructral nodes" is constructed, and it is relatively stable. 
> ## When more and more virus sequence is added, like the tree leaves, some of the "novel" leaves could potentially move the tree a tiny bit.
> > ### The following visualization is from "Wind and Words" By Impossible Bureau, ranked "The 25 Best Data Visualizations of 2018".

> ## Finally, we aim to dilver a visualization accessible to everyone, just like the screen protection image on Mac OS
